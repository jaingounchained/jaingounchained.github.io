## Work Experience

### [Accenture Japan](https://www.accenture.com/jp-ja), Team Lead/Consultant (January 2021 - Present)

#### Client: Accenture Internal

- **Led a team of 8 engineers** to reverse engineer and translate **10000+ lines of IBM Mainframe Assembler** legacy code
- Authored comprehensive specifications and converted **3000+ line Assembler code to Java**, resulting in a robust system
- Automated job submission on the mainframe environment by developing **shell scripts** utilizing **FTP**, reducing developer workflow time by 50%

#### Client: Biggest e-commerce platform of Japan

- Developed and tested a Fraud Prevention System: a **micro-service based architecture** involving 15+ micro-services in Go, Java, JS(Nodejs), Scala, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, GoCD, Spinnaker
- Migrated **SQL & Java (OLTP)** based report generation system to **Go & Elasticsearch (OLAP)** based system, reducing the report generation time from **~1 hour to ~1 minute**
- Identified and resolved **memory leak in a critical Go service** that necessitated hourly restarts and compromised transaction processing. **Achieved 100% transaction processing** eliminating the need of service restarts
- Diagnosed **memory leak in Nodejs & cassandra** based monitoring service. Implemented back pressuring in the **Apache Kafka consumption stream**, enhancing the monitoring service's reliability
- Implemented an **end-to-end testing framework in python**, including an **Apache Kafka** consumption framework. Conducted end-to-end and performance testing, ensuring smooth product releases
- Enhanced a **Scala-based fraud rule parsing and evaluation service** by extending its capabilities to support new rule types and fields. Documented the rule grammar using **EBNF**

#### Client: Instant Messaging Platform

- Designed and implemented a suite of **Python automation tools** to automate marketing processes, **reducing task time from ~5 hours to ~10 minutes**, significantly enhancing team productivity
- Identified and resolved slowdown issues on the client's website during marketing campaigns (high load) by conducting comprehensive **load tests using the Java Gatling framework**
- Horizontally scaled the client's website based on load test results, achieving **99% availability** during marketing campaigns
- Identified and resolved bugs in the client's website, conducted thorough local testing, and utilized **blue-green deployment strategy** to ensure smooth and uninterrupted website deployment
- Independently migrated from a legacy **Cloud Foundary(PaaS) service** to a **Docker Swarm architecture**, designing a scalable architecture, containerizing the service, and deploying to production
- Spearheaded the migration of a legacy system to new servers on the **company's IaaS** platform, ensuring a seamless transition with minimal downtime

## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Go, Python, Java, Scala, Javascript(Nodejs), Cobol, Mainframe Assembler, HTML/CSS, Bash shell
- **CI/CD Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, GCP (cloud), Docker swarm, GoCD, Spinnaker
- **Relevant Technologies**: SQL, Elasticsearch/Kibana, Apache Kafka, Cassandra, Linux, GNU core utils

## Personal Projects

### [IBM Mainframe Assembler educational tool](https://github.com/jaingounchained/kss-rag-demo)

Implemented **RAG in Python (llamaindex)** to develop an assembler educational tool

- Developed a tool using the **OpenAI Chatgpt LLM API** and **Llamaindex Python framework** to explain Assembler commands with short description, examples and references; **Response time: 5-10 seconds**
- Created in-memory **vector indices** from a 1000+ page IBM Assembler documentation using OpenAI's embedding model

### [Chess engine (In progress)](https://github.com/jaingounchained/go-djaingo-unchained)
    
An ambitious project to develop a **chess engine in Go**

- Implementing efficient **bitboard** representation of chess pieces and moves, optimizing the engineâ€™s speed by employing **low-level bit manipulation techniques**
- Acquired in-depth knowledge of advanced programming concepts, including **byte manipulation**, **bit masking**, and algorithms for efficient data handling

## Hobbies

- Futsal
- Ice skating
